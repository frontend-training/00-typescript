# Homework

All attendants must have the following software installed in their machines:

- Latest stable Node version with CLI access. https://nodejs.org/ (feel free to provision node and npm in the way you find more comfortable)
- Git.
- Github account with access to the AS24 organization.
- IntelliJ Enterprise or a code editor of choice. (we encourage people to use the Jetbrains eco system for development and is the one we feel more comfortable with and will facilitate pairing)
